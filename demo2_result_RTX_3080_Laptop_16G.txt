In this case, the trial court found that the
veteran's current psychiatric disability,
characterized as PTSD, was not incurred in or
aggravated by his military service.  The evidence of record
shows that the veteran was not treated for a psychiatric
disability until many years after service.  He was not
diagnosed with PTSD until approximately 2000.  The veteran
was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed
personality disorder, which the Board finds to be a
disability that began many years after service.  There is no
medical evidence showing a link between the veteran's
current psychiatric disability and his military service.
Accordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against
the veteran's claim.  38 U.S.C.A. ยง 5107(b) (West 1991);
38 C.F.R. ยง 3.303 (1999).

The Board notes that the veteran's representative contends
that the veteran should be afforded an additional VA
psychiatric examination.  In this regard, the Board notes
that the VA examination report, dated in June 1999, shows

In this case, the trial court found that the appellant's
service medical records did not show that the appellant was
treated for a right knee disorder while on active duty, and
that there was no evidence of any right knee complaints in
service.  In addition, the appellant has not provided any
competent medical evidence to show that the claimed
disorder was present during service or within one year of
discharge.  In fact, the appellant's service medical records
are negative for any indication of treatment for a right knee
disorder, and there is no competent medical evidence of a
current right knee disorder.  The Board notes that the
appellant is competent to report symptoms as they come to
him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470
(1994) (lay testimony is competent when it regards features
or symptoms of injury or illness).  However, the appellant's
statements regarding the presence of a current right knee
disorder are not competent evidence of the required nexus
between his current right knee disorder and his active duty

In this case, the trial court found that the veteran's
claim was well grounded.  However, in view of the
determination below that the veteran's claim is not well
grounded, it is unnecessary for the Board to reach the
question of whether the veteran has submitted a well-
grounded claim for service connection for a low back
disability.  In addition, the Board notes that the RO
complied with the VCAA in the development of the veteran's
claim, and there is no prejudice to the veteran by the
Board's action in this regard.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4
Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993).

II.  Factual Background

Service medical records reveal that the veteran was treated
for back pain on several occasions during service.  At
separation, the veteran reported that he had recurrent back
pain.  In April 1981, the veteran was seen for back pain.
The veteran reported that he had injured his back in the
Navy, but had no history of back pain.  The diagnosis was
back

In this case, the trial court found that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the Veteran's PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.  As noted above, the Board finds that the VA medical opinion of record is not probative.  The VA examiner, after reviewing the claims file and interviewing and examining the Veteran, opined that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not incurred in or caused by his service-connected PTSD.  The VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by his PTSD.  The VA examiner stated that there was no evidence that the Veteran's PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.  The VA examiner noted that there was no evidence of a relationship between PTSD and hypertension.  The VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was caused or aggravated by his PTSD.  The VA examiner noted that there was no evidence that the Veteran's PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.  The VA examiner also stated that the Veteran's hypertension was not caused by his PTSD.  The VA examiner stated that there was no evidence of a relationship between PTSD and hypertension.  The VA examiner also noted that there was no evidence that the Veteran's PTSD caused or aggravated his hypertension.  The VA examiner
