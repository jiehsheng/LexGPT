In this case, the trial court found that the Veteran was 
unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation 
due to his service-connected disabilities.  The Veteran has 
not argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that 
his service-connected disabilities have caused marked 
interference with his employment, or that they have required 
frequent periods of hospitalization.  The Veteran has not 
alleged, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that 
his service-connected disabilities have caused marked 
interference with his employment.  As such, the Board finds 
that the criteria for referral for consideration of an 
extraschedular rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.321(b)(1) 
are not met.  See Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337 (1996); 
Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995).

In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the Court held 
that a claim for a total rating based on individual 
unemployability (TDIU) is part of an increased rating

In this case, the trial court found that there was clear and 
unmistakable evidence that the veteran had a pre-existing 
bilateral knee disorder and that such disorder was not 
aggravated by service.  However, the Board finds that the 
evidence does not show that the veteran's preexisting 
bilateral knee disorder was aggravated by service.  The 
service medical records show that the veteran had a 
patellofemoral syndrome of the left knee, but there is no 
evidence that the disorder was aggravated by service.  
Further, there is no evidence that the veteran had any 
symptoms prior to his entry into service.  The veteran was 
examined in June 1967 for his entrance into service and the 
examiner stated that the veteran's knees were normal.  
Although the veteran reported a history of a trick or locked 
knee on his report of medical history, the veteran's knees 
were clinically evaluated as normal.  The veteran did not 
complain of any knee pain or injury in service.  The 
veteran was discharged from service because of the normal 
examination of his knees.

In this case, the trial court found that the evidence 
established that the veteran was unable to work as a result 
of his PTSD.  In reaching this conclusion, the trial court 
noted that the veteran had been receiving Social Security 
benefits for the same condition since March 1992, and that 
the veteran's PTSD was manifested by chronic pain, 
depression, memory loss, and impaired concentration.  The 
court noted that the veteran had been in receipt of 
disability benefits since February 1992, and that he had 
been working full time since that time.  The court also 
noted that the veteran had reported that he was unable to 
work due to PTSD symptoms, but that the symptoms had not 
significantly changed.  The court also noted that the 
veteran had reported that he had a very good relationship 
with his wife, and that they had been married for many years 
prior to the veteran's separation from service.  The court 
noted that the veteran had not been able to work since the 
time of his separation from service, and that the veteran 
was currently in
