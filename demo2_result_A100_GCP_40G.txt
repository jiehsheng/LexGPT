In this case, the trial court found that there was no clear and convincing evidence to establish that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is due to an event in service.  Specifically, the trial court found that there was no evidence of any hearing loss in service, and there was no evidence of any post-service hearing loss.  Thus, the trial court found that there was no clear and convincing evidence that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was caused by an event in service.  As such, the trial court found that the Veteran was not entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  Thus, the Veteran has not satisfied his burden of showing that he is entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  As such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

In addition to the above, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted a private audiogram dated in March 2011.  However, this audiogram was not considered by the March 2011 VA examiner.  As such, the Board finds that the private audiogram is not of sufficient probative value to warrant a grant of service connection.  Moreover, as noted by the March 2011 VA examiner, the Veteran's hearing was normal at the time of the

In this case, the trial court found that the appellant's claim 
was not well grounded, and denied the appellant's claim.  
Therefore, the Board finds that the appellant has not 
presented evidence sufficient to justify a belief by a fair 
and impartial individual that his claim is well grounded.  
38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (West 1991).

Where the claim is not well grounded VA does not have a 
statutory duty to assist a claimant in developing facts 
pertinent to the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(a) (West 1991); 
Littke v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 90 (1990).  VA may be 
obligated under 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) (West 1991) to advise 
the appellant of the evidence needed to complete his 
application.  Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69 (1995).  
However, this obligation depends on the particular facts of 
the case and the extent to which the Secretary has advised 
the

In this case, the trial court found that there was sufficient evidence to find that the appellant was not credible.  As discussed above, the trial court was not required to accept the appellant's statements that he was in a car accident.  Therefore, the trial court's decision that the appellant was not credible was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.  Therefore, the trial court's decision was not clearly wrong or manifestly unjust.  The appellant's first assignment of error is without merit.
 {¶ 7} In his second assignment of error, the appellant argues that the trial court erred by not granting him a new trial on the basis of the State's failure to provide discovery.  Specifically, the appellant claims that the State failed to provide him with a copy of the victim's statement to the police, the police report of the accident, and the police report of the appellant's statement.  In support of his claim, the appellant cites to several cases in which this Court has held that the failure to disclose the victim's statement to the police does not violate a defendant's due process rights.  See, e.g., State v. Smith (1985), 17 Ohio St. 3d 98, 100; State v. Brown (1994), 69 Ohio St. 3

In this case, the trial court found that the Veteran's 
hypertension was not related to service.  The Veteran's 
hypertension was first diagnosed in 2001.  However, as the 
Veteran was not diagnosed with hypertension until more than 
two decades after his separation from service, the Board 
finds that the Veteran's hypertension is not related to 
service.  

The Veteran also alleges that his hypertension is related to 
his service-connected PTSD.  The Veteran's PTSD is 
service-connected.  The Veteran has been diagnosed with 
hypertension.  However, as noted above, the Veteran's 
hypertension was not diagnosed until more than two decades 
after his separation from service.  Additionally, the 
Veteran's hypertension was not diagnosed until more than 
three decades after his separation from service.  
Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran's 
hypertension is not related to his service-connected PTSD.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the preponderance of the 
evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to 
service connection for hypertension.  As the preponderance of
